Black Friday Sales Purchase Prediction This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior using a Black Friday sales dataset and build a predictive model for purchase amounts across various product categories.  The work includes:  Data cleaning and preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dropping irrelevant features.  Exploratory data analysis (EDA): visualizing customer demographics, product categories, and purchase patterns to gain insights.  Feature engineering and scaling to prepare data for modeling.  Splitting data into training and testing sets for reliable model evaluation.  Developing a predictive model to estimate purchase amounts, enabling personalized offers and targeted marketing strategies.  This repository provides a comprehensive approach to transforming raw retail sales data into actionable business insights through data science and machine learning.
